            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>Financial difficulties continue to be a barrier for high school graduates to pursue their higher education in Cambodia. 

                60% of the working poor population survives with less than $3 USD a day.In consequence, many young Cambodians must drop their studies, move to neighboringcountries, and end up working in very difficult conditions to send some money home. 
                
                77% of the population lives in rural areas and 49% is under 25. Most secondary education is provided on a fee-paying basis, and is therefore inaccessible to most students, especially in rural areas.</p>
